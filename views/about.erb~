			<p>Aling Nena's store started when she was young, a dream of startingher own business filled her young mind. As she grew up, her dreams were met with trials, for when she reached an appropriate age to start her own business the economy faced too many rises and fallings; the economy was too unstable. Thinking it was too dangerous to start her own business, she decided to put her dream on hold to pursue a more stable career path.</p><br/>
			<p> But everyone around her could see where her passion really lies, and when her daughter had finally graduated from school, a stable career path of her own, she decided to surprise Aling Nena with a small store.</p><br/>
